<section><h3>Units All Come Pre Assembled &amp; Our Cost Less Than B &amp; Q.</h3><br/><p>The company are trade and your fitter will get the kitchen for you. I&#039;m more asking about how the kitchens actually stack up quality wise, after sales service, guarantees and are they honoured or do you have to argue with them. Howdens do too but less options.</p><h3>It’s Seems Ok But I Definitely Think Diy Kitchen Unit And Doors Are Better.</h3><br/><p>The kitchen fitter i'm using also uses howdens, so i've looked on their website and am impressed, and also the rental property we are in at the moment has a basic howdens kitchen and the units are good quality compared to b&q. Ikea to have some brilliant storage soloution that pull out of cupboards. Magnets have the best kitchens off the shelf probably, fitted 100's.</p><h3>They’ve Had It In A Few Years And The Door Edges Are Starting To Peel.</h3><br/><p>But on the other hand, reading up the specifications it sounded like the current b&amp;q carcasses have stronger back panels. Kitchen fitters can charge £150 a day per person. As with any kitchen, get a good fitter.</p><h3>Howdens Despite Their Sale Are Approx 25% More Than B&amp;Q.</h3><br/><p>Ideally i would see a range of assembled howdens units to get a sense for their stability. Our howden’s units are ok, for the money, but the appliances they supplied are terrible, they’ve all broken within 4 years. B&amp;q kitchens are the worst company that i have ever had the misfortune to come across!</p><h3>Have Looked At B&amp;Q Kitchens But Not That Impressed With The Quality, But Have A Limited Budget As We Are Renovating A Whole House.</h3><br/><p>Ikea kitchens, howdens and b&amp;q were on our hit list. I&#039;ve been to wren, howdens, wickes and bnq so far and obviously was put under pressure to buy. Just a heads up howdens are trade only and their prices are better than b&amp;q etc for kitchen units etc.</p></section><section><aside><img title="For a tranquil kitchen that makes you want to start" alt="For a tranquil kitchen that makes you want to start" rel="nofollow" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/fd/38/aefd385b97f7f66e73ffd8a0fcd588f7.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small></center><br><p>Not had any experience of howdens whatsoever.
