Are you tired of constantly stooping over your kitchen counter while preparing meals? Do you find it difficult to reach items on your counter because it is too high or too low? If so, you've come to the right place. In this article, we will discuss the standard kitchen counter height in cm and provide you with all the information you need to create a comfortable and functional kitchen space.</p><p>When it comes to designing or remodeling a kitchen, one of the most important considerations is the height of your kitchen counter. The height of your counter can greatly impact your overall kitchen experience, from cooking to cleaning. If the counter is too low, you may find yourself bending over uncomfortably. On the other hand, if the counter is too high, you may have difficulty reaching items or even experience back pain. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the standard kitchen counter height in cm that suits your needs.</p><h2>What is the standard kitchen counter height in cm?</h2><p>The standard kitchen counter height in cm is typically around 90 cm (35.5 inches).
