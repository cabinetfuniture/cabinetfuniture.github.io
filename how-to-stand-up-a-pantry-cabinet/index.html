<section><h3>The Pantry Will Hit The Ceiling When They Try To Tilt It Back Into Place And Get Stuck.</h3><br/><p>Just measure the diagonal of the cabinet end and make sure it is shorter than the ceiling is tall.

Turn a bookcase into a petite movable pantry with the addition of casters and painted lath attachments designed to secure pantry goods when the cart is in motion. That would mean up to 26 to be able to swing the pantry shelving units.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Tall Pantry Free Standing / Corner Pantry" alt="Tall Pantry Free Standing / Corner Pantry" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/foter.com/photos/373/2-door-storage-cabinet-7.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small></center><br><p>Keep the pocket holes hidden by positioning the back to face the wall, and the top and bottom pieces facing the floor and ceiling.
